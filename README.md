# **Bayesian Framework for Mode Identification in Monophonic Music Using KDE and Interval Distributions**

## **1. Introduction**
Musical mode identification is an essential problem in computational musicology, particularly for non-Western tunings and modal systems such as maqam or raga. Traditional approaches to mode identification rely on symbolic encodings, rule-based systems, or time-series modeling using Markov chains. This proposal outlines a probabilistic framework that employs kernel density estimation (KDE) to obtain pitch distributions, derives interval distributions, and applies Bayesian inference for real-time mode recognition.
