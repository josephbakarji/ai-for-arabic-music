# **Bayesian Framework for Mode Identification in Monophonic Music Using KDE and Interval Distributions**

## **1. Introduction**
Musical mode identification is an essential problem in computational musicology, particularly for non-Western tunings and modal systems such as maqam or raga. Traditional approaches to mode identification rely on symbolic encodings, rule-based systems, or time-series modeling using Markov chains. This proposal outlines a probabilistic framework that employs kernel density estimation (KDE) to obtain pitch distributions, derives interval distributions, and applies Bayesian inference for real-time mode recognition.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Frequency Estimation and Log-Scale Transformation**
Given an audio signal $ x(t) $, we extract the fundamental frequency \( f(t) \) over time using a pitch estimation algorithm, such as the constant-Q transform (CQT) or other Fourier-based methods. The estimated frequency is converted to a logarithmic scale in cents:

\[
c = 1200 \log_2 \left( \frac{f}{f_0} \right)
\]

where \( f_0 \) is a reference frequency (typically A4 = 440 Hz). This transformation ensures that equal-ratio intervals appear as equal differences in the transformed space.

### **2.2 Kernel Density Estimation of Pitch Distribution**
Since musical notes exhibit variability due to tuning, vibrato, and performance nuances, the observed pitch distribution is continuous rather than discrete. To model this, we use KDE:

\[
p(c) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} K_h(c - c_i)
\]

where \( K_h \) is a Gaussian kernel function with bandwidth \( h \). The peaks of \( p(c) \) correspond to stable pitch centers in the performed piece.

### **2.3 Interval Distribution from Pitch Distribution**
From the KDE-derived pitch distribution, we compute the probability distribution of interval differences:

\[
p(\Delta) = \int p(c) p(c + \Delta) \, dc.
\]

This captures the likelihood of observing particular pitch intervals, which is central to mode recognition. The set of dominant intervals defines the modal structure of the music.

### **2.4 Bayesian Inference for Mode Recognition**
Given a hypothesis \( H \) that a piece follows a particular mode (e.g., a makam or raga), we seek the posterior probability:

\[
P(H \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H) P(H)}{P(D)}
\]

where:
- \( P(D \mid H) \) is the likelihood of observing the interval distribution \( p(\Delta) \) given the hypothesized mode.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the mode, which can be informed by musical context or historical data.
- \( P(D) \) is a normalizing factor ensuring valid probabilities.

If each mode is characterized by a set of expected intervals \( \mu_H \), we assume:

\[
P(D \mid H) = \prod_{k} \mathcal{N}(\Delta_k \mid \mu_{H,k}, \sigma^2).
\]

This allows us to compare observed intervals against theoretical expectations and dynamically update mode probabilities as new notes are encountered.

### **2.5 Real-Time Bayesian Updating**
Since musical pieces evolve over time, we employ an online Bayesian update:

\[
P(H \mid D_{\text{new}}) \propto P(D_{\text{new}} \mid H) P(H \mid D_{\text{old}}).
\]

As new pitch intervals are observed, the mode probabilities are refined, allowing for adaptive mode recognition.

## **3. Expected Contributions**
This approach offers several innovations:
1. **Continuous Pitch Representation:** Unlike symbolic methods, KDE-based pitch distributions account for microtonal variations.
2. **Probabilistic Interval Modeling:** The use of interval distributions captures the essence of modal music systems.
3. **Bayesian Mode Identification:** Real-time inference enables dynamic recognition of modes based on evolving pitch patterns.

## **4. Future Work**
Future extensions may include:
- Incorporating **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** to model sequential dependencies in melodic progressions.
- Exploring **unsupervised learning** to cluster interval distributions into modal families.
- Extending to **polyphonic music** using probabilistic polyphony tracking.
